# Page Layout Decision Tree (v2.2)

**Purpose:** Ensure technical data clarity and "Industrial Intuition" by matching layout structures to image orientation and content density.

## Universal Hero Image Specification
*Mandatory standard for ALL hero images.*

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Pixel Dimensions** | **1440 × 500 px** (minimum) |
| **Aspect Ratio** | **16:9** or wider (panoramic preferred) |
| **Placement** | `object-cover object-center` |

## Step 1: Alignment & The "Starting Line"

**Mandatory:** Keep the `<h2 />` and introductory paragraph (`<p />`) **FULL-WIDTH** above any grid.
- **Why?** This ensures the "Starting Line" of the technical image and the data-table are perfectly aligned at the top. 
- **NEVER** put the intro paragraph in a 2/3 column - it displaces the image downwards.

## Step 2: The Orientation Logic Gate

### 1. STACK (Row Layout) IF:
- **Wide Images (Aspect Ratio > 16:9):** System skids, modules, plant drawings.
- **Short Adjacent Text:** Less than 5 lines. (Prevents massive white voids).
- **RESOURCE CONFLICT:** You have a **Tall Image** AND a **Data-Heavy Table**. Grids will cramp both. **STACK** to give the table full width and the image full height.

### 2. GRID (Column Layout) IF:
- **Tall/Vertical Images:** Centrifuge tubes, tall components. (Vertical orientation fits column shapes).
- **Square Product Photos:** Motors, valves, detail shots.
- **AND** there is substantial text (5+ lines) to wrap with.

## Step 3: The "Fit" Matrix (Grid Ratios)

| Image Type | Grid Ratio | Tailwind Classes |
|---|---|---|
| **Vertical/Tall Image** | **40% Image : 60% Text** | `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-5` (Img: 2, Text: 3) |
| **Standard Product Photo** | **33% Image : 66% Text** | `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3` (Img: 1, Text: 2) |
| **Complex Diagrams** | **50% Image : 50% Text** | `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` |

---

## Step 4: Component Consistency

- **Images:** 
    - `w-full h-auto object-contain rounded-xl shadow-sm border border-gray-100`
    - **NEVER** use `max-h` on vertical (tall) images. It shortens them and ruins the professional look.
- **Tables:** 
    - Wrap in `not-prose overflow-x-auto border border-gray-100 rounded-xl`.
    - Priority: Data readability. If the table looks cramped, change the Grid Ratio or **Stack**.

## Step 5: Final Quality Audit

**STOP.** Do not take screenshots. Ask:
1.  **Hero Quality:** "Is the hero sharp and 16:9? If no, replacement needed?"
2.  **Legacy Sketches:** "Are there hand-drawn or blurry graphs? Should I draw clean SVGs?"
3.  **Starting Line:** "Are the Image and Table aligned perfectly at the top?"
